XMolecule_Full_Limited_Express IN THIS NAME IS THE ENCRYPTED APPROXIMATION IN WHICH TO SOME LK the system of equations is solved, then it is seen that the higher harmonics are known
This program in the Hartree-Fock approximation calculates the radial parts of the wave functions of the molecule
basic and excited states of the discrete spectrum by solving the system of Hartree-Fock equations. The program solves the system of Hartree-Fock equations for the molecular
Orbitals in a single-center view. The basic approximation is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (fixed position of the nuclei).

!! Explanation of the name
MoleculeXFFLE
MoleculeXF_Full_Limited_Express
MoleculeXF-FOR THE APPROXIMATION OF THE FIXED POSITION OF NUCLEI BY THE SOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM OF HARTRY-FUCK EQUATIONS TO THE WAVE ELECTRON FUNCTION
MoleculeXF_Full- THIS APPROXIMATION REALIZES THE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING HIGHER HARMONICS.
MoleculeXF_Full_Limited-IN THIS APPROXIMATION, THE SOLUTION IS FOR A LIMITED SET OF HARMONIC. Under this, the higher harmonics are obtained by decomposing the Wave functions of the Ligand electrons.
                        There is a production of the obtained solution and functions of the ligands.
MoleculeXF_Full_Limited_Express-In this case, to accelerate the calculation of the direct and exchange part of the molecular potential
                                Preliminary calculation of the potential between the partial harmonics of molecular orbitals
                                The resulting potentials are written to files. In the future, only potentials with changed molecular orbitals are recalculated.
VER 2,3 - DATA VERSION BEGINS THE OPPORTUNITY OF SELECTING THE MASSIVE IN THE OPERATIVE MEMORY FOR CAPACITY BUILDING
          AND IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THEN FILES ARE USED.
